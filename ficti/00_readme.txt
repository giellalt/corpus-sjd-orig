THE BOOK
The book includes three different text genres
1) a short biographic essay in Kildin Saami (which is perhaps not "fiction" but "facta") without translations
2) a few chapters with fairy tales in Kildin Saami without translations
3) a narrative in Kildin Saami without translations
There is also a wordlist for the last mentioned narrative, resulting from lemmatizing all words included in this text.
