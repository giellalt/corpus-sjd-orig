.eaf is the name extension for ELAN files, but it is an XML file (and can be opened as such)

The programm ELAN links text annotations to audio/video, it can be used both for  creating and presenting time aligned text annotations of multimedia data. ELAN has also built-in a corpus search tool, incl. regex, cross-tier, and cross-corpus (across more than one ELAN-file) search functionality.

ELAN is the annotation and presentation software used by the Pite and Kola Saami and (in the future) Izhva-Komi Dcumentation Projects. Since the text annotations   written by us in ELAN include minimally an orthographic tier and one translation into the local lingua franca, these data can be used as parallel corpora.

Special conventions for representing characteristics of spoken language (not occuring in the other GT corpora), like false starts, hesitations, etc. are still needed.

The current ELAN example file KIL061212AfanasjevaNE_Ryhp_Clip131206 includes more tiers than for orthography and one translation, see the screenshoot.
